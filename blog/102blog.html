                <h2>Fourth Blog</h2>
                <p id="top">This week marked the beginning of my journey to learning web development. A smoky haze of which was my vision of creating a website, 
                    was quickly dispelled as I attended the lecture about cascading style sheets. I watched the videos my professor had linked us to
                    <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/17594">watch</a>. My brief knowledge of hypertext markup language was 
                    drastically built upon as I discovered the limitless potential designing with CSS allowed. I explored the deep, vast depths of the box 
                    model. The organization and formatting is unparalleled to many other design models. I was initially overwhelmed, nearly brought to tears, 
                    at the beauty of the box model. The unconquerable behemoth of developing a website had begun showing its mortality. The glimpse of light 
                    at the end of the tunnel grew brighter. But then disaster struck.
                </p>
                <p>A lab was assigned in class Tuesday to apply my newly acquired skill, 
                    the box model. I wielded it mightily as I rode into battle. We fought gallantly until the enemy flanked us with the task to remove the gap 
                    between the card and the top of the browser. No matter how hard our battalion fought, we could not conquer the task. We instead decided to 
                    shift our focus to the other tasks at hand. We bravely changed the background color of the cards and added an outside image to each one.</p>
                    <code>
                        .card {<br> 
                            &nbsp; background-color: blue;<br>
                            &nbsp; border-style: solid;<br>
                            &nbsp; border-color: black;<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>As we began turning back to deal with the original flank, the horns began to sound. This signaled the end of breakout room and time to submit 
                    the assignment. We had finished every task correctly besides the dreaded margin between each card. The result of the battle may not have been 
                    perfect, but we fought together as a true team and gained experience with the box model.
