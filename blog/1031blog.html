                <h2>Sixth Blog</h2>
                <p id="top">This week in web development, we began learning React js. So because of this, I have chosen to read and explain 
                    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-error-boundaries">this React blog I read</a>. This article
                    discusses error boundaries and how to handle possible errors a user's browser can throw when using a React application. 
                    Continue reading to find out how to prevent your app from crashing.

                    Errors can be a common, unavoidable challenge that must be overcome when developing an application. Sometimes these errors 
                    can be caused by developmental accidents like accessing an object that doesn't exist. But sometimes, errors can be out of the 
                    developers hands like a failed http request to a third party API. So we must have a way to deal with these issues if they arise.
                    This is where error boundaries come into play. Error boundaries are a strategy for handling errors through the use of two methods
                    in React components. They are the getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch methods. 
                </p>  
                <code>
                    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {<br>
                        &nbsp;// Update the state so next render shows a fallback UI.<br>
                        &nbsp;return { error: error };<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>
                <p>GetDerivedStateFromError is a method that updates the state when an error is discovered so the application can display one last 
                    render instead of a broken component.
                </p>
                <code>
                    componentDidCatch(error, info) {<br>
                        &nbsp;// Log the error to an error reporting service<br>
                        &nbsp;logErrorToMyService(error, info);<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    ComponentDidCatch is a method that is a tool for triggering side effects when an error is detected. An example use of this method
                    is logging the error or saving the stack trace to make it easier for the developer to debug the application. Any react component
                    is considered an error boundary if it contains one of these two methods. It is always a good idea to implement atleast one of these
                    methods in the root of your application. Error boundaries are only designated to detect errors during the render phase, in a lifecycle
                    method, or in the constructor. So in areas where this does not apply, like event handler errors, must be handled through the use of 
                    try-catch statements.

                    Thank you for joining me as I begin my journey into React.js development. I hope you learned something new this week along with me and I
                    hope you join in next week as we continue learning React.
