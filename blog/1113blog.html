                <p id="top">One common criticism of React is that it is centered around one page applications. This stinks, right? What if we want
                    our React application to have multiple pages? Well I have discovered the solution that fixes this issue and drastically expands
                    the limits of what can be done in your application.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The solution is through using the react-router library. This library enables the user to navigate between different parts of the
                    application by clicking on an element or url. So how do we make use of this library? I utilize 
                    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-router-include-router-hooks/">this blog</a> 
                    to help learn how to use this technology.
                </p>
                <code>
                    npm install react-router-dom
                </code>
                <p>
                    You must first install the library by typing the command obove into the terminal. Next we must open the App.js file and import the library.
                    This is done by typing:
                </p>
                <code>
                    import { Router } from "react-router-dom";
                </code>
                <p>
                    A router alone doesn't do anything. So we must now add rendering routes. We adding the element to App.js, you only need to
                    define two properties: path and render. Path defines what is the homepage and render will display that content when the path is 
                    reached. If you wish to display a real component instead, you will want to use the component property. This sounds great but 
                    how do we switch pages? This is what links are used for. Instead of using a and href tags, we will instead want to use links and to.
                    This allows the switching of pages without having to reload the page. To check what page to switch to, we will use the Switch. They
                    function similary to switch case statements in other languages, but instaed of cases you will want to use routes. This will finally give
                    you the ability to switch pages using React.
                </p>

                    I hope you enjoyed learning about Routes in React and how to add multiple pages to your application. I learned a lot and I hope to see
                    you next week as our web development journey continues!
