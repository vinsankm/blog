                <h2>First Blog</h2>
                <p id="top">This week I began learning what flex box is and how it makes formatting a HTML file much easier. The three main
                    benefits it gives you is: control over the distribution of children along the  main axis, the alignment of the children
                    along the cross axis,and the contraction and expansion of the children along both of the axis. Lets dive into the topic
                    of flex box.
                </p>
                <code>
                    .card {<br> 
                        &nbsp; flex-direction: column;<br>
                        &nbsp; justify-content: space-between;<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Justify-content controls how the children are placed along the main axis. The properties are: flex-start, flex-end, center, 
                    space-between, space-around, and space-evenly. Flex-direction controls which way the main axis is orientated, whether it be
                    horizontally or vertically.The properties are row and column.
                </p>
                    <code>
                        .card {<br> 
                            &nbsp; align-items: center;<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>
                <p>
                    Align-items controls how the children are placed along the cross axis. The available properties are: flex-start, flex-end, 
                    center, and stretch. Most of them are self explanatory besides baseline. Baseline aligns the text horizontally in line with 
                    which the text sits upon. Now that I learned how the alignment of children works on the x and y axis, I can now focus on 
                    the width or size of each child. That is where flex-grow comes into play.
                </p>
                    <code>
                        .card1 {<br> 
                            &nbsp; flex-grow: 1;<br>
                        }<br>
                        .card2 {<br> 
                            &nbsp; flex-grow: 2;<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Flex-grow works as a ratio the defines the width of each child across the main axis. Flex-grow works as a ratio and can grow
                        or shrink according to the browser size. In the example I gave, the two children have a 1:2 sizing ratio. This means that
                        card1's width will be 33% of the parents width, while card2 will be 66% of its parents width. This can be altered though
                        through the use of flex-basis. Flex-basis controls the initial main size of a flex child. This value is defaulted to auto,
                        but it can be changed to fit your needs. An example woul dbe to set the flex-grow to 0. This would initialize the child to
                        fit the width of its content and no larger. You could also do the reverse and set it to 200px, causing the flex child to begin
                        with a width of 200 pixels.
                    </p>

                        Thank you for following me along my journey to learning the deatails of flex-box and how to use it. I hope to see you next week
                        when we delve even deeping into the waters of web development!
