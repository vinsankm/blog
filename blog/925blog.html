                <h2>Third Blog</h2>
                <p id="top">This week I read an <a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/8-emmet-tips-you-might-not-know">article</a> on the various ways to code 
                    like a boss on Visual Studio Code using Emmet. Emmet is a plug
                    in to make typing and working with HTML much more efficient. An example of the efficieny Emmet allows can be seen here:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &nbsp; div.foo#bar<br>
                    &nbsp; &lt;div class="foo" id="bar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This is a neat little shortcut that makes creating divs with a class and tag much quicker. The div lets Emmet know that
                    you are creating a div. The .foo lets Emmet know you want the div to be in class foo. And the #bar lets it know you want the
                    div to have an id of bar. Instead of typing it all out manually, you just have to type the shortcut and hit tab. This can be
                    even more efficient if you want to create multiple divs because all you have to add is a *(number of divs) at the end of it and
                    it will make that many divs with the criteria you defined for it. Thats just one example of the quality of life improvements
                    provided to us by Emmet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emmet does not only provide keyboard shortcuts but also provides us with some tools. One really useful tool is the "Wrap with 
                    Abbreviation" tool. Normally if you wanted to put a new div around existing html, you would have to type out the new div,  
                    copy and paste everything into that new div, then manually have to fix the indentation. The Wrap with Abbreviation tool does
                    this all for you. You just highlight the text you want to wrap then type what you would like to wrap it with. 
                </p>
                <code>
                    &nbsp; {count: $}*3<br>
                    &nbsp; count: 1<br>
                    &nbsp; count: 2<br>
                    &nbsp; count: 3<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This shortcut uses the $ operator. It lets Emmet know that you want that to serve as a incrementing variable. So if you multiply
                    it by 3 then that $ will be substituted for 1, 2, and 3 in each line in pastes. This can be very useful if you are working with
                    larger numbers or want to create a set of divs with different classes or ids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last trick we will be discussing is the balance inward and balance outward Emmet commands. What these commands do are
                    change the highighted/selected area. Each time the balance outward command is used, the selected area expands to its parent tag.
                    Balance inward does the opposite, in how it shrinks the highlighted area each time the command is used. It is recommended to create
                    a keybind for these commands so they can be used quickly and in succession easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoyed learning about some Emmet tips with me this week. I hope you join me next Friday as my journey into web development
                    continues.
