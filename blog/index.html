                <p>This week marked the beginning of my journey to learning web development. A smoky haze of which was my vision of creating a website, 
                    was quickly dispelled as I attended the lecture about cascading style sheets. My brief knowledge of hypertext markup language was 
                    drastically built upon as I discovered the limitless potential designing with CSS allowed. I explored the deep, vast depths of the box 
                    model. The organization and formatting is unparalleled to many other design models. I was initially overwhelmed, nearly brought to tears, 
                    at the beauty of the box model. The unconquerable behemoth of developing a website had begun showing its mortality. The glimpse of light 
                    at the end of the tunnel grew brighter. But then disaster struck...

                    This week I began learning what flex box is and how it makes formatting a HTML file much easier. The three main
                    benefits it gives you is: control over the distribution of children along the  main axis, the alignment of the children
                    along the cross axis, and the contraction and expansion of the children along both of the axis. Without further ado, 
                    lets dive into the topic of flex box.
