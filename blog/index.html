                <p>This week marked the beginning of my journey to learning web development. A smoky haze of which was my vision of creating a website, 
                    was quickly dispelled as I attended the lecture about cascading style sheets. My brief knowledge of hypertext markup language was 
                    drastically built upon as I discovered the limitless potential designing with CSS allowed. I explored the deep, vast depths of the box 
                    model. The organization and formatting is unparalleled to many other design models. I was initially overwhelmed, nearly brought to tears, 
                    at the beauty of the box model. The unconquerable behemoth of developing a website had begun showing its mortality. The glimpse of light 
                    at the end of the tunnel grew brighter. But then disaster struck...

                    This week I began learning what flex box is and how it makes formatting a HTML file much easier. The three main
                    benefits it gives you is: control over the distribution of children along the  main axis, the alignment of the children
                    along the cross axis, and the contraction and expansion of the children along both of the axis. Without further ado, 
                    lets dive into the topic of flex box.

                    This week I read an <a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/8-emmet-tips-you-might-not-know">article</a> on the various ways to code 
                    like a boss on Visual Studio Code using Emmet. Emmet is a plug
                    in to make typing and working with HTML much more efficient. An example of the efficieny Emmet allows can be seen here:

                    I was creating the homepage for my project in my web development course and I wasn't too happy with how it was looking.
                    I was curious if there was a way to make it look more modern and and depth to it. That's where my topic for the week was chosen.
                    I decided to look into the ability to blend objects using CSS. This is the article I read and will be relaying my learnings to
                    you from. The first aspect is the background property. It can use methods like linear-gradient(), radial-gradient(), and others.
                    But it can also us a property called background-blend-mode. Backgrounds that used to only be possible by setting an image, can now
                    be done using a CSS property.

                    Most programming languages revolve around equations and functions to complete their function. But did you know that 
                    CSS can also employ the usage of functions. This week's blog will be spent exploring what functions are used for and how
                    they can be implemented.

                    This week in web development, we began learning React js. So because of this, I have chosen to read and explain 
                    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-error-boundaries">this React blog I read</a>. This article
                    discusses error boundaries and how to handle possible errors a user's browser can throw when using a React application. 
                    Continue reading to find out how to prevent your app from crashing.

                    As my journey to mastering React continues, I have decided to learn a Javascript library called Redux. To assist me in learning this technology, I read this and followed this

                    One common criticism of React is that it is centered around one page applications. This stinks, right? What if we want
                    our React application to have multiple pages? Well I have discovered the solution that fixes this issue and drastically expands
                    the limits of what can be done in your application.

                    It has been a great adventure yall. We began not knowing what html and css were and how they were different, 
                    I didn't know the basics of React, and much more. It has been a long journey and much has been learned. I hope you benefitted
                    as much as I did from these few weeks of learning web development. This week instead of learning a new aspect of web development
                    and relaying it to you though my blog, I am instead going to act as if I were going to teach a web development course next semester.
                    I am going to explain how I would design the course and what projects I would assign to help them learn.
