    <h1>Blog for September 8th</h1>
    <p>
        This week marked the beginning of my journey to learning web development. A smoky haze of which was my vision of creating 
        a website, was quickly disspelled as I attended the lecture about cascading style sheets. My breif knowledge of hypertext
        markup language was drastically built upon as I discovered the limitless potential designing with css allowed. I explored the deep, vast depths
        of the box model. The organization and formatting is unparallelled to many other design models. I was initially overwhelmed, 
        nearly brought to tears, at the beauty of the box model. The unconquerable behemoth of developing a website had began showing
        its mortality. The glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel grew brighter. But then disaster struck. A lab was assigned in class 
        Tuesday to apply my newly aqcuired skill, the box model. I weilded it mightily as I rode into battle. We fought galliantly until the 
        enemy flanked us with the task to remove the gap between the card and the top of the browser. No matter how hard our battallion fought,
        we could not conquer the task. We instead decided to shifted our focus to the other tasks at hand. We bravely changed the background
        color of the cards and added an outside image to each one. As we began turning back to deal with the original flank, we horns began to sound.
        This signalled the end of breakout room and time to submit the assignment. We had finished every task correctly besides the dreaded margin between
        each card. The result of the battle may not have been perfect, but we fought together as a true team and gained experience with the box model.
