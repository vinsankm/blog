                <p id="top">As my journey to mastering React continues, I have decided to learn a Javascript library called Redux. To assist me in learning this technology, I read this and followed this 
                    <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/the-only-introduction-to-redux-and-react-redux-youll-ever-need-8ce5da9e53c6">article</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Redux is a React library that is used to manage the application's state in a single immutable state tree. It is similar to a
                    global instance that stores information that can be used later in the application. An example usage of this technology could
                    be a loading bar for a website that renders while the loading state is true. There are no rules or limitation on what a developer
                    can be stored in Redux, besides that it has to be serialized. Two very important patterns to note and acknowledge as you develop 
                    using Redux are: single source of truth and immutability. Single source of truth means that there is only one Store that you can 
                    keep track of the state for the whole application. The second pattern, immutability, means that you do not directly access and alter
                    the state object and its properties. Instead, a new object will need to be created and you can then recalculate and update the state using 
                    that new object. Redux itself has three main parts: actions, reducers, and store.
                </p>
                    <code>
                        const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer)<br>
                        store.subscribe(render)<br>
                        const value1 = document.getElementById('value')<br>
                        function render() {<br>
                        &nbsp;const state = store.getState()<br>
                        &nbsp;const newValue = state.value.toString()<br>
                        &nbsp;value1.innerHTML = newValue<br>
                        }<br>
                        render()<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>Store contains the state of the application. It is technically an object, even though it may look like a Javascript class.
                        When creating the redux, it is important to remember that you follow the Redux pattern that it should have only one store.
                        The developer can put as many values and nest them as much as they want inside the store.
                    </p>
                    <p> The second main part of Redux are actions. Actions describe what happened in the state but not how they happened. One criteria
                        actions must meet is that they require a certain type field. This field's purpose is to describe what action is being dispatched.
                        Another aspect of actions are Action Creators. They are functions that create and return plain Javascript objects. Their purpose 
                        is to allow for dynamic data insertion into the actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I am going to discuss the third main aspect of Redux which are Reducers. Reducers are functions that define how the 
                        application's state changes. When an action is dispatched, the action then gets passed to the reducer. A reducer function takes
                        two parameters: the past app state and the action being dispatched. This function then recalculates the new state and returns it.
                        So the general data flow in redux is the UI dispatches an action to the reducer. The new state returned by the reducer is then saved
                        inside of the store. 
                    </p>

                        I hope you enjoyed this weeks topic of learning Redux and learned soemthing new. I hope to see you next week as our journey into web 
                        development continues.
