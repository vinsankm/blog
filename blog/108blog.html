                <p id="top">Most programming languages revolve around equations and functions to complete their function. But did you know that 
                    CSS can also employ the usage of functions. This week's blog will be spent exploring what functions are used for and how
                    they can be implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other programming languages where you can create your own functions, in CSS that falls onto the CSS selectors. Another
                    difference is that the functions effect a specific area, unlike other languages where a function can have ramifications
                    throughout the entirety of the code. 
                </p>
                <code>
                    .glowBorder {<br>
                    &nbsp; filter: drop-shadow(0.25rem 0 0.75rem #ef9035)<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The drop-shadow function is a perfect example of this. It is a calculation that only affects what you tell it. Drop-shadow calculates how
                    to determine the hue, transparency, etc. for you. This just one of many functions that make creating fluent visuals much easier. These functions
                    can be used for more than just static visuals. They can also be used to make animations.
                </p>
                <code>
                    .animatedThing {<br>
                        &nbsp;transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.17, 0.67, 0.83, 0.67);<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This function is more complicated than the other one but how we use it is very similar. All the programmer has to do is call the function 
                    and provide numbers for the calculation. This function takes the parameters and creates custom timing for your animations. One use of the 
                    function is that it allows you to vary the animation's speed over the course of the animation. There are far more functions available to 
                    use in CSS and I implore you to explore them as well to improve your web development capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoyed this weeks blog post exploring the use of functions in CSS. I you enjoyed and that I see you next week!
