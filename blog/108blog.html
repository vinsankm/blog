                <h2>Fifth Blog</h2>
                <p id="top">I was creating the homepage for my project in my web development course and I wasn't too happy with how it was looking.
                    I was curious if there was a way to make it look more modern and and depth to it. That's where my topic for the week was chosen.
                    I decided to look into the ability to blend objects using CSS. <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/compositing-and-blending-in-css/">This</a> is the article I read and will be relaying my learnings to
                    you from. The first aspect is the background property. It can use methods like linear-gradient(), radial-gradient(), and others.
                    But it can also us a property called background-blend-mode. Backgrounds that used to only be possible by setting an image, can now
                    be done using a CSS property. A large benefit to this is the quicker load times. What it does is it blends one object with another
                    allowing for layering and a mixing of color palletes.
                </p>
                <code>
                    &nbsp; background-image: firstPicture.png, secondPicture.png;<br>
                    &nbsp; background-color: blue;<br>
                    &nbsp; background-blend-mode: multiply;<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    What the example above does is set the background to two different images. It takes those images and applies the blend mode "multiply".
                    Multiply takes the color values of the firs timage and multiplies it with the second image's. This is just one of many modes that can 
                    be applied. The varying mdes mix colors or calculate the combination differently depending on what you want it to look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to the background-blend-mode, there is the property mix-blend-mode. Where background blend is used to only to mix background
                    elements, mix blend can affect any element. A common use for this is to combine text with the background in a visually pleasing manner.
                </p>
                <code>
                    &nbsp; mix-blend-mode: difference;<br>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The mix blend mode difference takes the target element and sets its color to be the opposite of the backgrounds. This can be
                    used in many cool ways. One way is to create translucent text or text that looks like it can interact with the background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoyed this weeks blog post exploring blending in CSS. I hope to see you next week!
