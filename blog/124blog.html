                <p id="top">It has been a great adventure yall. We began not knowing what html and css were and how they were different, 
                    I didn't know the basics of React, and much more. It has been a long journey and much has been learned. I hope you benefitted
                    as much as I did from these few weeks of learning web development. This week instead of learning a new aspect of web development
                    and relaying it to you though my blog, I am instead going to act as if I were going to teach a web development course next semester.
                    I am going to explain how I would design the course and what projects I would assign to help them learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to start off by saying that I really enjoyed the way my current web development course was taught at JMU. I think
                    it was probably as good as the class could get without having the option to be in person for the class. Having uploaded videos
                    that cover different topics before our class meeting time was very beneficial and helped us prepare for the lab each day.
                    That segways into what to do with in class time. I really liked how we worked together with classmates to complete a coding problem
                    that reinforced what we learned in the videos. I do think thye would be more effective/fun if they could be in person, but due to COVID
                    I still found them to be effective in teaching me new topics. I think the course could benefit from having a section of the course be 
                    dedicated to teaching design principles and how to make a good ux/ui. While we learned how to actually make a website, I never really knew
                    how to make a really good and visually pleasing website.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for following me along my journey to learning the web development. Its been fun and I wish you all the best 
                        in your future front end development.
